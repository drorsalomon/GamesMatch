# GamesMatch

The GamesMatch website allows gamers to be matched with games based on their unique personality traits. 

Once the user is registered on the website, he may answer a 50 question survey that tests different personality markers. Once the answers are provided, 
the system matches the user with games best suited for him according to his unique personality traits.

The website also provides a free game search section that provides details about thousands of games.

Admins on the website have access to statistics about users survey answers and games saved on the database, aggrogated using the MongoDB aggregation pipeline.

The project is built using Node.js, MongoDB, express, mongoose, pug templates for server side rendering, JavaScript for API calls using axios, Nodemailer and
SendGrid for sending emails to users and SCSS.
